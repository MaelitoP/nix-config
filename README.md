# nix-config

> ✨ Modular, reproducible, and architecture-aware `nix-darwin` configuration for macOS

This repository contains my personal and professional Nix-based configuration system for macOS machines using [`nix-darwin`](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin), [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), and [`nix-homebrew`](https://github.com/zhaofengli/nix-homebrew). It is optimized for reproducibility, scalability across architectures, and clarity.
